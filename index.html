        <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time!</h2>
        <p class="text">Adventure tourism is defined as the movement of the people from one to another place outside their comfort zone for exploration or travel to remote areas, exotic and possibly hostile areas. Adventure tourism is a type of tourism in which tourist do some adventures activities like as skydiving, hill climbing, Biking,Para Gliding,Surfing etc.Adventure tourism is very popular among young age tourists. Adventure tourism gains much of its excitement by allowing the tourists to step outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing cultural shock or through the performance of acts, that required some degree of risk (real or perceived) and physical danger.Adventure travel is a leisure activity that takes place in an unusual, exotic, remote or wilderness destination. It tends to be associated with high levels of activity by the participant, most of it outdoors.  Adventure travelers expect to experience various level of risk, excitement, and tranquility and be personally tested. In particular, they are explorers of unspoiled, exotic parts of the planet and also seek personal challenges</p>

        <p>Adventure tourism is a new concept in the tourism industry. Tourism industry adopted adventure tourism, but there is not any specific definition of adventure tourism. Most commentators concur that adventure tourism is a niche sector of the tourism industry, but there are many other niche sectors in tourism which have same characteristics that overlap with adventure tourism such as ecotourism, activity tourism or adventure travel.One of them can confuse. Adventure tourism is a complicated and ambiguous topic. Some important definitions of adventure tourism are following as: “adventure tourism is a tourist activity that includes physical activity, cultural exchange, or activities in nature.”
         According to Muller and Cleaver, “Adventure tourism is characterized by its ability to provide the tourist with relatively high levels of sensory stimulation, usually achieved by including physically challenging experiential components with the tourist experience.”</p>

            <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p class="text">Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office – and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise. In cities, bikes help lessen traffic congestion and assist in solving seemingly perennial parking problems, as well as offering easier manoeuvrability. The bike, then, has plenty of things going for it – it’s kinder to the environment; it costs little to buy, operate and maintain; it is incredibly convenient to own; and it is the ideal way to fitness. All of these factors contribute towards making cycling a fun and enjoyable activity.
            There are three types of cycling: Utility, recreational (touring, organized rides, mountain) and racing.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>There is still debate over when the first bicycle was designed (1839 is the given date, Kirkpatrick Macmillan the designer). But it was the velocipede (sometimes known, for obvious reasons, as the “bone shaker”) which was the first pedal-operated bike to be mass produced. Meanwhile, the modern bike traces its origins to the Rover, a safety bike and an invention of the 1880s.
            The first instance of a cycling race being held was in 1868, in Paris. A year later, the first race between cities was organized, from Paris to Rouen. The heyday of racing began in the final decade of the 19th century; one-day classic races, like the Paris- Roubaix (1896), date back to that decade. After France, other European nations – Belgium, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands – also started organizing races. And just as the era of road races was beginning, cycling as a recreational activity started gaining popularity. The Tour de France, the gruelling three-week test of endurance around the French countryside, is one of sport’s most iconic competitions. It has been held since 1903,
            its fame growing with each edition (though the seemingly uncontrolled doping that has afflicted the Tour – and, indeed, the sport – in the last decade or so, has somewhat dented the public’s faith in cycling). The Giro d’Italia (Italy) and the Vuelta a España (Spain) complete the European triumvirate of summer road races. Europe is the venue for most of the world’s top road races but the United States and Asia also host road competitive races.

            <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.First you have to take the parachute to the hill where you will make your jump. Be aware that the weight of parachute can vary between 6-15 kg. When you climb up the hill, all you need is a paragliding wing. As the paragliding pilot, you should be careful to make sure that the field is not obstructed by anything such as trees or structures. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The paragliding pilot should run down the hill, and there is no need to run too fast because the wind will help enough already. The type of sports parachute used in paragliding is designed for easier take off and landing.It is always a better choice to learn from someone prevalent in the sports. And thanks to the paragliding courses in various places, you can easily bring this extreme sport to your life.</p>

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing’s roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability. Here is everything you need to know about surfing in India.India’s 7500 kilometre coastline provides several spots for surfboarding. The largest waves are typically seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season.Waters of India are already well-liked for hosting a range of adventure sports like rafting, kayaking, sailing, stream crossing, and plenty of others. One such upcoming sport is Surfing in India.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Surf-worthy waves hit Indian shores all year round, averaging between three to five feet, however the season for large waves is from May to September. This is the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. At this point, the swells vary from eight to fifteen feet, with the largest waves rolling in almost always on the West Coast.Though there is a chance of storms and rain accompanying the swells, surfers often find the best breakers during these months.From October to April, the waters become gentler and also the waves retreat to normal. Occasionally, bigger swells are created on both the coasts by small storm systems. This is the small swell season (also the peak traveller season) and it’s the most effective time for beginners learn to surfing in India.</p>
